            This privacy policy governs your use of the Daily Inspire mobile application.
            
            1. Introduction

            2. Information Collection and Usage
            
            While using Daily Inspire, we do not directly collect any personal information from you. However, our app uses Google Mobile Ads, a third-party service, which may collect information used to identify you.
            
            3. Third-Party Services
            
            Daily Inspire uses Google Mobile Ads to serve ads within the app. Google Mobile Ads may collect information, such as device information and location data, to serve personalized ads based on your interests and browsing behavior. For more information on Google's privacy practices, please visit their privacy policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.
            
            4. Ad Personalization
            
            Users may see personalized ads based on their interests and browsing behavior. You can opt-out of personalized ads through your device settings.
            
            5. Data Sharing
            
            We do not share any user data with third parties, except as required by Google Mobile Ads to provide advertising services.
            
            6. Data Retention
            
            As we do not directly collect user data, we do not retain any user information. Google Mobile Ads may retain data in accordance with their privacy policy.
            
            7. User Rights and Choices
            
            Users have the right to access, modify, or delete their information collected by Google Mobile Ads, as outlined in Google's privacy policy.
            
            8. Security Measures
            
            We are committed to protecting your privacy and have implemented reasonable security measures to safeguard any information collected by Google Mobile Ads.
            
            9. Children's Privacy
            
            Daily Inspire is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by applicable law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
            
            10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
